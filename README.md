# Frontdesk-HITL-AI (Human-in-the-Loop System)

A simulated **Human-in-the-Loop AI Supervisor** system for a salon, built for the **Frontdesk Engineering Test**.  
This project demonstrates how an AI receptionist can intelligently **escalate to a human supervisor**, **learn from their response**, and **update its knowledge base** automatically.



When the AI agent receives a customer call:
- If it knows the answer → responds immediately.
- If it doesn’t → says *“Let me check with my supervisor”* and creates a **help request**.
- A human supervisor views pending requests on the dashboard and replies.
- The AI then:
  - Follows up with the customer.
  - Updates its **knowledge base** so it can answer next time.
